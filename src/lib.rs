//! PPMd compression / decompression. It's a port of the PPMd C-code from 7-Zip to Rust.
//!
//! The following variants are provided:
//!
//! - The PPMd7 (PPMdH) as used by the 7z archive format
//! - The PPMd8 (PPMdI rev.1) as used by the zip archive format
//!
//! ## Notice
//!
//! There are two ways to properly bound the uncompressed data:
//! 1. Save the uncompressed size along the compressed data and use `std::io::Read::read_exact()`
//!    to read the data (this is what is used in the 7z archive format).
//! 2. Encode an end marker by calling `finish(true)` on the encoder when finishing the encoder
//!    process. You can then use `std::io::Read::read_to_end()` to read the data. You are of course
//!    free to also use the `std::io::Read::read_exact()` if you have stored the uncompressed data
//!    size (this is what is used in the zip archive format).
//!
//! Failing to do so will result in garbage symbols at the end of the actual data.
//!
//! ## Range coders for PPMd var.H
//!
//! [`Ppmd7Decoder`] and [`Ppmd7Encoder`] use the range coder of 7-Zip's 7z format. Files written
//! by the original `ppmd` tool (`.pmd`) use the carry-less range coder instead; [`Ppmd7aDecoder`]
//! and [`Ppmd7aEncoder`] read and write that form with the same model.
//!
//! ## Acknowledgement
//!
//! This port is based on the 7zip version of PPMd by Igor Pavlov, which in turn was based on the
//! PPMd var.H (2001) / PPMd var.I (2002) code by Dmitry Shkarin. The carryless range coder of
//! PPMd8 was originally written by Dmitry Subbotin (1999). These authors put the original code
//! into the public domain.
