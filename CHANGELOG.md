## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `Ppmd7aDecoder` and `Ppmd7aEncoder` for PPMd7 (PPMdH) with the carryless range coder (PPMd7a), as used
  by the `.pmd` files of the original PPMd program.
- Added `restart_range_coder` to `Ppmd7aDecoder` and `Ppmd7aEncoder`, which starts a new coded stream
  while keeping the model, as RAR archives do between the PPMd blocks of a file.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Fixed out-of-bounds heap reads and writes in the PPMd8 model restoration path (GHSA-rqc2-j9v2-j22v).

## 1.4.0 - 2026-01-23

### Changed

- Re-licensed this crate under CC0-1.0 and MIT-0.
- There are no functional changes between 1.3 and 1.4.

## 1.3.0 - 2025-11-01

### Added

- Added "get_ref/get_mut" to all decoder and encoder to geta access to the inner reader / writer. By roblabla (#10)

## 1.2.1 - 2025-07-05

### Added

- Add an `unstable-tagged-offsets` unstable feature used to validate the proper function of the implementation. It is
  not activated as a general safety feature, since it would reduce the maximal allowed memory size and in such break
  compatibility with existing data.

## 1.2.0 - 2025-07-03

### Added

- Auto traits Send and Sync are implemented for the decoder and encoder.

## 1.1.2 - 2025-07-03

### Fixed

- No functional changes
- Fixed links in cargo to fix broken link in crates.io

## 1.1.1 - 2025-07-03

### Fixed

- Fixed errors in the ported code that created different PPMd code for both PPMd7 and PPMd7:
  (https://github.com/hasenbanck/ppmd-rust/issues/3)

### Added

- Added bigger test corpus to verify implementation.

## 1.1.0 - 2025-06-28

### Added

- Added a `finish()` method on the encoders, so that finishing the encoding process is more straightforward.
- Allow the encoding of an end marker into the compressed data to properly support cases, where the uncompressed data
  size if not known at decompression time.

## 1.0.0 - 2025-06-27

### Updated

- Ported the C code for PPMd8 to Rust (as used in the ZIP archive format).
- Lowered MSRV to 1.82

## 0.3.0 - 2025-06-22

### Updated

- Ported the C code for PPMd7 to Rust (as used in the 7z archive format).

## 0.2.0 - 2025-02-28

### Added

- Provided a safe Rust abstraction over the 7zip PPMd C library
